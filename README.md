## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add/Remove products from the cart
- Edit product quantities in the cart
- Fill in all fields in the checkout
- Receive form validations if fields are missed or incorrect during checkout
- See correct checkout totals depending on the products in the cart
  - Shipping always adds $50 to the order
  - VAT is calculated as 20% of the product total, excluding shipping
- See an order confirmation modal after checking out with an order summary
- **Bonus**: Keep track of what's in the cart, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)

## My process

    This is my first "big" project, as such I'll have to subdivide this into phases so that I can have an MVP (minimum viable product) to showcase while the rest of the functionality is still being worked on

    PHASE 1:
        Full home page working
        Done by December 20 2023
    PHASE 2:
        Category pages working
        *Ongoing*
    PHASE 3:
        Individual product pages working
    PHASE 4:
        Add to cart UI working
        Add to cart functionality and pricing math working

    Next phases will be turning this into a fullstack app, but that will be for further in the future

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
